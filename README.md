# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL--TASK3


Explanation of the Code and Project
This project implements an image classification web app using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It consists of two main components:

Frontend: The user interface for uploading an image and displaying the classification result.
Backend: The logic to handle image uploads, preprocess images, and classify them using a trained CNN model.
Project Workflow
1. Frontend
The frontend is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a simple, user-friendly interface:

HTML:
Displays a form where users can upload an image (<form> tag).
Includes labels, buttons, and a section to display results.
CSS:
Styles the interface to make it clean and modern.
Provides hover effects for buttons and labels to enhance usability.
JavaScript:
Uses the fetch API to send the uploaded image to the backend.
Dynamically updates the results section with the predicted class and confidence returned by the server.
2. Backend
The backend is a Flask application that:

Loads the trained model:
The model is a TensorFlow/Keras CNN trained for image classification.
The load_model() function loads the .h5 model file.
Handles image uploads:
The @app.route('/upload') route processes the image sent via the form.
Checks if the uploaded file is valid and allowed (png, jpg, or jpeg).
Preprocesses the image:
Converts the uploaded image into a format compatible with the CNN model:
Resizes the image to match the input shape of the model (32x32 for CIFAR-10).
Normalizes pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Expands the dimensions to match the modelâ€™s input format (batch size).
Makes predictions:
Uses the CNN model to predict the class of the image (model.predict()).
Extracts the class with the highest probability (np.argmax()) and confidence score (np.max()).
Returns the result:
Sends a JSON response containing the predicted class and confidence to the frontend.
Key Features
User-Friendly Interface:

Simple and intuitive layout for uploading images.
Real-time results displayed after classification.
End-to-End Workflow:

Combines a trained CNN model with a web interface for deployment.
Handles all steps: upload, preprocess, predict, and display.
Reusability:

Model can be swapped with any trained image classification CNN.
Compatible with other datasets by adjusting preprocessing steps (e.g., image size).
Code Walkthrough
Frontend:
HTML:

html
Copy code
<form id="upload-form" action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <label for="file-input" class="file-label">Choose an image</label>
    <input type="file" id="file-input" name="image" accept="image/*" required>
    <button type="submit" class="btn">Classify</button>
</form>
The <form> element collects the user-uploaded image.
The action="/upload" specifies that the form submits to the backend /upload route.
The enctype="multipart/form-data" allows image uploads.
CSS:

css
Copy code
.btn {
    padding: 10px 20px;
    background-color: #28a745;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
    font-size: 16px;
}

.btn:hover {
    background-color: #218838;
}
The button for submitting the image is styled with hover effects.
JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
form.addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(form);
    
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/upload', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: formData
        });
        
        const data = await response.json();
        resultDiv.innerHTML = `
            <p>Predicted Class: <strong>${data.class}</strong></p>
            <p>Confidence: <strong>${(data.confidence * 100).toFixed(2)}%</strong></p>
        `;
    } catch (err) {
        resultDiv.innerHTML = `<p class="error">Error: Unable to classify the image.</p>`;
    }
});
Prevents the default form submission and sends the image using the fetch() API.
Dynamically updates the result section with the predicted class and confidence.
Backend (Flask):
Model Loading:

python
Copy code
MODEL_PATH = 'path_to_your_model.h5'
model = load_model(MODEL_PATH)
Loads the trained CNN model (e.g., trained on CIFAR-10 or another dataset).
Image Preprocessing:

python
Copy code
img = image.load_img(file, target_size=(32, 32))
img_array = image.img_to_array(img) / 255.0
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
Converts the uploaded image into a NumPy array.
Resizes the image to match the CNN input size.
Normalizes pixel values to the [0, 1] range for better performance.
Prediction:

python
Copy code
prediction = model.predict(img_array)
predicted_class = np.argmax(prediction)
confidence = float(np.max(prediction))
Predicts the class probabilities using the trained model.
Extracts the class with the highest probability and its confidence score.
Project Flow
User Uploads an Image:
The form allows users to upload an image via the web interface.
Image Sent to Backend:
The backend receives the image, preprocesses it, and uses the CNN to classify it.
Backend Returns Results:
The predicted class and confidence score are sent back to the frontend.
Results Displayed:
The user sees the predicted class and confidence on the web page.
How to Run the Project
Set Up Environment:

Install the required libraries: Flask, TensorFlow, numpy, etc.
bash
Copy code
pip install flask tensorflow numpy
Prepare the Model:

Save your trained CNN model as a .h5 file and specify its path in the backend code.
Run the Flask App:

Start the server:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open the web app in a browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Upload and Classify:

Upload an image via the form, and view the results.
Use Cases
Custom Image Classification:
Replace the CNN model with one trained on a different dataset (e.g., animals, plants, vehicles).
Educational Tool:
Demonstrates how CNNs work in real-world applications.
Deployment Example:
Provides a complete end-to-end deployment pipeline for deep learning projects.
